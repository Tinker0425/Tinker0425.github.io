Day 18 of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) course, and where
does the time go! There have been other topics on my mind of late, and thus 
blogging was moved to the side, but hoping to get back into the flow of things.

My [Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/) notes have been surprisingly consistent. I am hoping to have 
module 2 notes mostly done today or tomorrow, as my homework will be finished 
tonight. And speaking of homework, homework 1 grades and the [leaderboard](https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/leaderboard)
are out for the 2025 cohort. My humblebrag is I am in the top 5 with 15 points at the moment. 
Feel free to follow-along as the weeks go by, my username is 'Cloudy Bluewave'.

Ok so week 2 is [Kestra](https://kestra.io/), and I have been really enjoying this week. My only issue
so far was getting caught up with a docker-compose.yml, that I still do not
have a fix for :/ The way Kestra way described to us in the videos was as an 
'Orchestra' and we need to tell the instruments when to come in and play.

Down to the studs, you are just building a work flow. In my day-to-day, the tool
I use to do this is powershell. But it would be so nice if we had something
with a use interface that could be used. Another way I could describe is
like powerautomate, but a million times better and with great documentation.

If you're interested in learning more about Kestra, I highly recommend going through
Will Russell's youtube videos for module 2 here in the [zoomcamp playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb).

Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/30/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there.
