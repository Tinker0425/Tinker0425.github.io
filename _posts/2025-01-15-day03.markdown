Day 3 of working through the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) 
and ran into another issue while running the jupyter notebook. I ended
up just creating my 3rd virtual environment, restarting everything, and that
solved the problem again. 

Time tracking wise, I am doing about 4 hours a night. I will say about half my time spent
so far has been due to virtual environment issues, so that has been frustrating. BUT maybe
I am close to becoming a pro with `conda create -n myenv python=3.12` :). This is also
likely a part of why we have 2 weeks to complete module 1, while we have 1 week for the other
modules. 

So, I was finally able to make it through [video 1.2.3](https://youtu.be/hCAIVe9N0ow?si=s07-aBQYqF91Wjpr).
My strategy through this course is that I watch the videos with CC at 1.75 speed first, just
to get an idea of what is going on, what may need to be downloaded, what weblinks we are
looking at etc. Then, I go back to where I left off with my work and pick up from there. I find that
this method of seeing the videos multiple times helps me understand the concepts.


If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2, this [medium article](https://medium.com/@ywg/data-engineering-zoomcamp-series-my-notes-8fd1f4706716)
was shared in the slack channel and is very organized!

Hoping to make some more progress in my [Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/) tonight. 

***
Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/15/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there.
