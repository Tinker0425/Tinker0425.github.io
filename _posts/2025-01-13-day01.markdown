Day 1 of a new class is always so exciting! A blank slate and that 
new notebook smell. I must admit I have spent way too much 
time 'setting-up' for this course, and what I mean by that is 
I now have a Blog, that you're reading right now!,
a [Github repo](https://github.com/Tinker0425/data-engineering-zoomcamp-my-work) for my course homework, a 
[Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/) that is in the works and will host my notes 'like a book' - has anyone ever done this before?! -
and a Notion dashboard that is private at the moment.

I find that tracking my time in notion and/or using pomodoro helps my productivity.

As for the course itself - there are a number of websites we are using. I created an 'app section' on my phone and
that has helped. These apps are [Slack](https://datatalks-club.slack.com/archives/C01FABYF2RG), 
[Github](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), 
[Telegram](https://t.me/dezoomcamp),
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@DataTalksClub),
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bnYs80DwuUimHM65UV3sylsCn2j1vziPOwzBwQrebw/edit?tab=t.0), and
[Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=er1r053veb2iqu4u1fhm635q0o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FAnchorage)

For the start of the course, I already had python and pycharm, 
but needed to download on my Mac docker desktop and google cloud platform (GCP), so far!

I have started a few of the youtube videos and hope to make more progress tomorrow as I 
just spent way too long trying to figure out how to get an image on my blog :/.


***
Interesting in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/13/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there.
