Day 4 and things were much smoother today, as in I don't think I encountered
any bugs or issues running things. I made it up to video [1.3.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBi0hHjLftk&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=13)
and really, truly do plan on going back into my [Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/) to update items tonight!
I think I would like to make some sort of checklist to help users follow-along with 
the course, as sometimes I feel I get lost.

One thing that has been helping me stay organized with this course is creating 
a [google chrome tab group](https://www.google.com/chrome/tips/#:~:text=Expand%20all-,Create,-your%20tab%20group). 
This way, I can open all the content I need at once. 

An area where I am unsure of the best method to document notes is how the videos may 
go through one...two...three different methods to do something. I may google some of 
these options and figure out which way is the most popular or efficient for someone working
from a Mac, but I am unsure of what documentation method I will take here. 

There are also some great [community ntes](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-docker-terraform#community-notes).
I had one set open today + the youtube video + my Google
cloud platform, and that method worked really well. BUT some notes are out of date and
sometimes portions of the videos are too, so that keeps you on your toes.

Also - if you are interested in making a blog similar to mine, it looks like
there is an easier way here at [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev/)!


***
Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/16/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there.
