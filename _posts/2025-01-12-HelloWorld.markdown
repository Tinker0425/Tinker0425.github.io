Welcome to my new blog! As of January 2025 - my main goal is to use this site as a blog while I take the [data engineering zoomcamp course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main). You can follow along here, through my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylaflynn/), or through [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cloudybluewave.bsky.social). I am hoping this will keep me accountable - cheers!
