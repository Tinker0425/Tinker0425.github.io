## An Integrated Damage, Visual, and Radar Analysis of the 2013 Moore Oklahoma EF5 Tornado

Tree fall reveals highly convergent surface flow over the majority of the damage path. At times, the convergent flow is observed at radii less than that of the condensation funnel. A photogrammetric analysis of still photos and video show that the damaging winds extend well beyond the condensation funnel location. The condensation funnel often coincides with the EF1, EF2, and EF3 isopleths. A comparison is made between independent ground and aerial surveys that rated 4039 structures along the entire damage path. The aerial survey produces a low bias in EF0 and EF1 ratings. No apparent bias is observed in the EF2-4 categories. It is not possible to draw definitive conclusions concerning the small number of EF5 rated structures.

## Wind Analysis

In this study, we present current analyses of surface wind speeds (SWS) for Buzzards Bay,
Massachusetts and T. F. Green Airport, Rhode Island. The two-parameter Weibull
distribution is used to characterize the mean hourly wind data at the surface for Buzzards Bay.
Seasonally at Buzzards Bay, it is shown that mean winds are stronger in the autumn months than in
summer months. The terrestrial site of T.F. Green Airport show annual trends of SWS decreasing in
the 1984-2007 dataset. Off shore and on shore observations will also be compared in this context.
Further analyses of more stations with longer datasets will increase knowledge of the distance scale of
land and sea breezes on coastal surface winds, which could lead to more accurate air temperature and
cloud coverage forecasts.
