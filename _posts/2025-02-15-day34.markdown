Day 35 of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) course and this
was the workshop week! We learned about the data load tool dlt! This is 
and open source library for python the makes data load easy and you
can learn more [here](https://github.com/dlt-hub).

I really enjoy that within the dlt github, and also for the workshop
we used ipython notebook in google colab to walk through the
process. I find it is a great learning tool! With the homework,
I was successful in creating my pipeline with dlt which pulls data 
from an API and loads it to duckdb in this case.

So what is the difference between dlt and dbt besides one letter? 
dlt is good for data ingestion (at the start of your pipeline), 
while dbt is good for data transformation and modeling, usually at the end!

Check out my [Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/) notes and homework solutions and feel free
to leave me a note in issues or ask any questions!

Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 2/15/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there. You can also follow
