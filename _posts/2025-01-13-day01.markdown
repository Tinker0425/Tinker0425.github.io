Day 1 of a new class is always so exciting! A blank slate and that 
new notebook smell. I must admit I have spent way too much 
time 'setting-up' for this course, and what I mean by that is I now have:
- A blog - that you're reading right now!
- A github repo for my hw here - https://github.com/Tinker0425/data-engineering-zoomcamp-my-work
- A gitbook in the works, that will host my notes 'like a book' - has anyone ever done this before?! Here is my link - https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/
- A notion dashboard (private at the moment)

I find that tracking my time in notion and/or using pomodoro helps my productivity.

As for the course itself - there are a number of apps / sources we are using. I created an 'app section' on my phone and
that has helped. These apps / websites are:
- Slack
- Github
- Telegram
- Youtube
- Google Docs
- Google Calendar

For the start of the course, I already had python and pycharm, 
but needed to download on my Mac:
- docker desktop 
- google cloud platform (GCP)

Interesting in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/13/25 and you can still join
the Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025 here or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live here - https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/
