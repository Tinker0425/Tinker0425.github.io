Day 30 of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) course and how
has it been 30 DAYS! Wow does time fly. I am so proud of all of us who have been 
consistent with this course. Alexey wasn't wrong in stating that the
first two weeks with docker were tough! It feels a lot smoother lately.

In module 3 we learned more about BigQuery and did you know you can play
around with things in a sandbox [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox)!
My favorite section of this week was talking about Partitioning and Clustering!
This image explains it pretty well, where we are just organizing the data
by 'partitioning' it and then in this case, by also clustering it by tags.

You can cluster for up to 4 fields! Also, you will likely only want to do 
partitioning and clustering if data size is larger than 1 GB, 
otherwise it may actually be more costly and won't save time. BigQuery 
automatically reclusters the table as new data comes in.

to leave me a note in issues or ask any questions!

Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 2/11/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there. You can also follow
along weekly, by checking the [leaderboard](https://courses.datatalks.club/de-zoomcamp-2025/leaderboard) to find homework submissions
and links to github repos and #learninginpublic - my username is 'Cloudy Bluewave'.
