Day 8 - A Whale's Tail
... is called a fluke

Day 8 of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) course, and my focus
for the past couple of days has been my [Gitbook](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/), specifically the
Docker section and my social media posts for #learninginpublic. I've surprisingly 
enjoyed blogging and my social media posts and connecting with the #dataBS
community. I posted my [first weekly post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaylaflynn_dezoomcamp-learninginpublic-activity-7287182867204292608-Xedg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
on linkedin today and find these a bit harder to write, but I know they will be good to have when I
am looking back at the course and want a big summary of what I have learned.

For those that do not know, the Docker logo is a whale :whale:. According
to the [community forum](https://forums.docker.com/t/where-does-the-idea-of-a-whale-on-the-logo-come-from/10874)
the whale logo came from the winner of a contest! I guess it used to be a more
friendly looking whale according to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cqbp10/docker_changed_their_icons_goodbye_friendly_whale/).

But I still love this. Could be
because of my background in oceanography, or my love for Juneau Alaska, or 
maybe it brings back discussions of the [Whale's Tail Waterpark](https://whalestalewaterpark.net/)
in NH.

Anyways, all of this to say that maybe I am enjoying learning Docker more because
I like whales lol? The logo is really just the coolest!

Interested in joining the course?! I am writing this 1/20/25 and you can still join
the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp Cohort 2025](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/) or if you're late to 
reading this, the material should still live there.
